## Features

### 🔐 Login System
Our system provides a role-based login mechanism for three types of users:
- `Patient` can log in to book appointments, view their medical record, and manage their profile.
- `Doctor`can log in to view and process their appointments, access patient information, and update medical records.
- `Admin` can log in to manage doctors, patients, specialties, and view all appointments.

> [!NOTE]  
> While patients can sign up themselves, only admins can create accounts for doctors and other admins, for safety reasons.

### 📋 Medical Record
This feature allows doctors to document and manage patient consultation details. Each record includes the patient's complaints, diagnosis, treatment, prescription, and additional notes so as to ensure accurate and organized trackings of patient health history across multiple visits.

As this feature contains sensitive and classified medical data, the table below specifies the access permissions for each user.  

| User Type  | View | Update | Note |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :---: | --- |
| `Patient`      |  ✅   |   🚫   |  Can view their own medical records for personal reference.
| `Doctor`      |   🔄   |       🔄      | Can manage medical records **only for patients they are currently treating via an active appointment**.
| `Admin`      |   🚫   | 🚫| Cannot access medical records to protect sensitive medical information.

### 📅 Appointment Scheduling
Patients can book appointments by selecting a doctor, specialty, and available time slot based on the doctor's working schedule.

Each appointment is linked to a patient, a doctor, and a scheduled time. Our system ensures that time slots do not overlap and only shows available options.

> [!NOTE]  
> Patients may book only one appointment per specialty, and each specialty can have its own maximum number of appointment slots (set by admins).

### 👨🏻‍⚕️ Doctor Scheduling
Each doctor has a predefined weekly work schedule (days and time ranges). This schedule determines their availability for appointments.

Admins can set doctor schedules, ensuring patients only book during valid time slots. The appointment system uses this schedule to validate and prevent double-booking.
### 🗂️ Clinic Data Management

Admins can manage core clinic data, including:
* **Patient data**
* **Doctor profiles** (name, specialty, schedule)
* **Specialties** (or departments)
* **Appointment monitoring**
